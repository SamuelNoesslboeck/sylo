A small helper library with components and sturctures frequently used in low level programming, especially with the arduino framework. Feel free to use the whole library or just copy single header files to use in your ardunio and co. projects. The code is not something game-breaking just snippets and stuff I frequently use, nicely packed together, documented and explained as best as I could.
